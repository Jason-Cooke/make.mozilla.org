<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Mozilla Foundation (“Mozilla”, “us” or “we”) is committed to promoting choice, creativity and innovation on the web.  That’s why Mozilla created the Mozilla Webmaker Events Platform – a publicly available space for people promote their events and campaigns designed to encourage people to come together to create and learn.</p>

<p>Your use of the Events Platform is subject to the terms and conditions of this Terms of Use (we will refer to these collectively as the “Terms”).  By using the Events Platform or registering for the Events Platform, you accept these Terms and agree to be bound to them.</p>

<h3>Modifications to the Terms</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms in our sole discretion and if we do make changes, we will post a notice on the Events Platform describing the changes that were made, so make sure to check back periodically.  We may also notify you through email or on the Events Platform itself. If you have any questions about these Terms or the Events Platform, please contact us.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>By using the Events Platform, you agree that: (i) you are at least 18 years old or are acting with the consent and supervision of your parent; and (ii) you have full power, capacity, and authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself, or if applicable, your employer or other entity that you represent. In any case, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age as the Events Platform is not available to users under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>Membership</h3>

<p>You may be required to create a user name and password to use certain features of the Events Platform.  Please remember that you will be responsible for any events scheduled or other activities resulting from use of your account credentials so make sure to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your password.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>

<p>Mozilla has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Mozilla’s sole discretion, remove any content or any user account that, in Mozilla’s reasonable opinion, violates any Mozilla policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Mozilla may at any time suspend or terminate your use of the Events Platform if Mozilla is no longer going to provide the Events Platform or Mozilla believes you have breached these Terms.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of your registration for and use of the Events Platform. You agree that any information provided by you will always be accurate, correct and up to date. Mozilla will use your information in conjunction with our operation of the Events Platform in accordance with the information handling practices in the <a href="{{ url('events_privacy') }}">Events Platform Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Your User Content</h3>

<p>Mozilla does not control and is not responsible for any, user submitted information, comments, data and content including, without limitation pictures and event information (“User Content”).  You are solely responsible for your User Content.  By submitting your User Content, you hereby grant us a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use, modify, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and distribute your User Content in connection with the provision and promotion of the Events Platform.  You may have the option to allow some or all your User Content to be shared publicly, such as when posting an event as public, if you select this option, you understand that your Content will be visible to the public in general on-line searches.  You represent and warrant that your User Content will not infringe the rights of any third party and will comply with our <a href="{{ url('events_content') }}">Content Guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>Events and Event Locations</h3>

<p>We enable our users to arrange events that are physical meetings at venues (“Events”).  In some cases we use the Events Platform to schedule our own official Mozilla events. If you wish to attend official Mozilla events, you will have to agree to the permissions and other policies governing those events. However, we do not organize most events on the Events Platform and we do not supervise and are not involved in any way with them.  Also, we do not control the actions of the non-Mozilla individuals who are present at either official Mozilla events or events created by third parties.   Because of this, you should exercise caution and good judgment when planning or attending Events.  We’ve created a set of <a href="{{ url('events_guidelines') }}">guidelines to help you</a>.</p>

<p>Because we cannot guarantee the true identity and age of event attendees and planners and we have very limited control, if any, over the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or accuracy of various aspects of the Events Platform, you agree that you bear all risk and you agree to release us (and our officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and third party partners) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, now and in the future, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your use of the Events Platform; or (b) your transportation to or from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other persons at an Event. You further waive any and all rights and benefits otherwise conferred by any statutory or non-statutory law of any jurisdiction that would purport to limit the scope of a release or waiver. You waive and relinquish all rights and benefits which you have or may have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any similar provision of the statutory or non-statutory law of any other jurisdiction to the full extent that you may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits.</p>

<h3>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice</h3>

<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and believe that content available by means of one of Mozilla’s websites infringes one or more of your copyrights, please immediately notify Mozilla’s Copyright Agent by means of emailed, mailed, or faxed notice (“DMCA Notice”) and include the information described below. You can review 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for authoritative detail, or consult your own attorney if you need assistance. If Mozilla takes action in response to a DMCA Notice, it will make a good faith attempt to contact the party that made such content available by means of the most recent email address, if any, provided by such party to Mozilla. You may be held liable for damages based on certain material misrepresentations contained in a DMCA Notice. Thus, if you are not sure content located on or linked to by the website infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an attorney.</p>

<p>All DMCA Notices should include the following:</p>

<ul class="faux_ol">
<li>1. A signature, electronic or physical, of the owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright right that is being infringed;</li>
<li>2. An identification of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed;</li>
<li>3. A description of the nature and location of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit Mozilla to find and positively identify that content, including the URL where it is located;</li>
<li>4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address where we can contact you; and</li>
<li>5. A statement by you: (i) that you believe in good faith that the use of the material that you claim infringes your copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's agent; and, (ii) that all of the information contained in your DMCA Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of, or a person authorized to act on behalf an owner of, the exclusive copyright right that is being infringed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mozilla’s designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is as follows:</p>

<p>Harvey Anderson<br />
Mozilla Corporation<br />
650 Castro Street, Suite 300<br />
Mountain View,<br /> CA 94041</p>

<p>Email: dmcanotice at mozilla dot com</p>
<p>Phone Number: 650-903-0800</p>
<p>Fax: 650-903-0875</p>

<p>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of a DMCA notice, Mozilla may not act upon your notice.</p>

<p>Mozilla will terminate a user’s account if, under appropriate circumstances, they are determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>

<p>The contact information provided above also applies to notices that are based on non-U.S. copyrights or trademarks.</p>

<p>Only DMCA Notices, Trademark Notices (which are defined below), and international copyright or trademark notices should go to the copyright agent.</p>

<p>Please be advised that any DMCA Notices sent to Mozilla may be sent to third parties (including the accused) and posted on the Internet (including at http://www.chillingeffects.org/).</p>

<h3>Trademark Notices</h3>

<p>If you are a trademark owner or an agent of a trademark owner and believe that content available by means of one of Mozilla’s websites infringes one or more of your trademarks, please immediately notify Mozilla’s Copyright Agent by means of emailed, mailed, or faxed notice (“Trademark Notice”) and include the information described above for DMCA notices. Mozilla handles notices it receives of trademark violations via a process very similar to the DMCA Notice process that is described above for copyrights. In addition to the DMCA Notice requirements, Mozilla requires that the entire Trademark Notice be made by the trademark owner (or her agent) under penalty of perjury.</p>

<h3>Export</h3>

<p>Some of the content you may download from Mozilla through the Events Platform may have legal restrictions on its export. You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and you confirm that you are not prohibited from receiving exports and services under US or other export laws.</p>
